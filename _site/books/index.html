        <p>This is sort of a virtual bookshelf where I keep a record of books I’ve read with a small review(one-liners). I don’t talk about what the book is about in-depth here, I have linked them to Goodreads for that, but rather what I think of it. This was inspired by <a href="https://rakhim.org/bookshelf/">rakhim’s</a> much cooler bookshelf with all the book covers and authors. Anyway, here goes:</p>

<h1 id="section">2018</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/290376.Indira">Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi *</a></strong>
<br />
One of the best book I’ve read on modern Indian history. Talks about one of the greatest leaders of our country with some flaws. There are certain bits that you’ll read twice before you even begin to understand what had happened. Must read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11724436-the-linux-command-line">The Linux Command Line</a></strong>
<br />
Can’t say much about this one, it’s a great book about the linux command line. Covers a bunch of commands and gives you a subtle intro to shell scripting. Loved reading this. It’s divided into three logical units, so you can pick any one of them and start off if you want to. It’s a long read but very informative nonetheless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30045683-the-little-book-of-hygge">The Little Book of Hygge: The Danish Way to Live Well</a></strong>
<br />
Not because it had my name one, I read it because I’m interested in the European culture and how they do things. This books talks about <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hygge</code> which is an important part of the Danish culture, there may not be a concrete definition of it but it refers to the feeling of being happy, cosy and comfortable with a close circle of friends with coffee in one hand while the thunder rumbles outside. Read it if you are interested in such things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air">When Breath Becomes Air *</a></strong>
<br />
Amazing, thrilling yet saddening in so many ways. You can tell when the author picks up the pace because he knows if he doesn’t then there might not be enough time to finish the book. Touches upon so many elements of the human life in such a way, it carries you through the whole journey. Must read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood">Norwegian Wood</a></strong>
<br />
Easy, relaxing, this gives you an insight about the japanese culture. All those talks about evening strolls and the japanese coffee places feels like an experience itself. It also talks about death, life and relationships. Overall, a good book and a fun read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984">1984</a></strong>
<br />
How fortunate we are to live in a society like this, this makes you think not once or twice, but thrice about the society and how it functions. Although, it’s a dystopian vision, there are instance where you can’t help but relate it to your current situation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a></strong>
<br />
This book is basically the title being stated repeatedly in somewhat different ways. Could have been a blogpost and done much better. I don’t get the hype around this, it was average.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30835567-hit-refresh">Hit Refresh</a></strong>
<br />
Some very important life lessons coupled with the transition of Microsoft from the old evil corp to the now community friendly organization, this was a delight to read. The part about Satya Nadella’s childhood and his growth was particularly interesting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112803.The_Story_of_My_Experiments_With_Truth">The Story of My Experiments With Truth *</a></strong>
<br />
Apart from the usual stuff about Gandhiji that we find almost everywhere, this book talks about Gandhiji as a person, a student, a family man and later a father figure of our nation. There are accounts of his peculiar diet, his preferred method of medication and therapy and his immense love for reading. Must read.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section-1">2017</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7613.Animal_Farm">Animal Farm</a></strong>
<br />
A pure genius that George Orwell is, this is a masterpiece. It makes you stop and think about the society every few pages. A small but an interesting and humorous read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/798635.iWoz">iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon</a></strong>
<br />
This was an amazing read. Steve Wozniak is such a genius, if it weren’t for him, there’d be nothing for Steve Jobs to sell. That’s what I understand from the book. Classic hacking anecdotes, university pranks and the rise of the personal computer, it has it all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164323.The_Google_Story">The Google Story</a></strong>
