I love building tools for the command line. Also, I'm paranoid about my workflow so you'll often find me fiddling with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/prakashdanish/dotfiles). I use (n)vim for all things writing and tmux for managing sessions. These are some of the things I've worked on in the past:


- [vim-zen](https://github.com/prakashdanish/vim-zen): Barebones vim plugin manager
- [goodreadsh](https://github.com/prakashdanish/goodreadsh): Command line interface for goodreads.com
- [vim-githubinator](https://github.com/prakashdanish/vim-githubinator): Quickly show selected text on Github
- [chromatic](https://github.com/prakashdanish/chromatic): Create monochromatic backgrounds on the terminal
- [vimport](https://github.com/prakashdanish/vimport): Vim plugin to quickly import and drop modules
- [amizone-cli](https://github.com/prakashdanish/amizone-cli): Command line interface for amizone.net
- [dash](https://github.com/prakashdanish/dash): Unix shell written with piping & history recollection
- [githubfs](https://github.com/prakashdanish/githubfs): Read-only virtual file-system for Github using FUSE
- [Chapelle Wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/Danish-Prakash-Chapelle-Wisdom/dp/B07B3YT38D): Amazon Alexa skill that helps uplift your mood
