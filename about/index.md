title: About
---

I'm an engineer at <a href="https://hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> where I work on backend systems writing Go most of the time. Before this, I interned at <a href="https://atlan.com" target="_blank">SocialCops (Atlan)<a/> where I also worked on developing tooling for internal use working mostly with Python.

# Colophon
A lot of people message me asking about the theme of this website and what I used to built it. It's your typical static website with quite some time spent fiddling with the design to get it to where it is right now. You can find the source for this website on [Github](https://github.com/danishprakash/danishprakash.github.io).

# Setup
I've my setup configuration files in this [repository](https://github.com/danishprakash/dotfiles). I'm more or less constantly working on the efficiency of my setup. It has equal amounts of aesthetics and efficiency. I'd love to talk more about it in depth but this probably is not the right place, maybe a post of it's own someday.
