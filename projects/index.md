I love building tools for the command line. Also, I use (n)vim for all things writing and tmux for managing sessions. All my code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/danishprakash) including this website. These are some of the things I've worked on in the past, loosely grouped by 3 categories, namely vim plugins, cli tools and others:


- [vim-zen](https://github.com/danishprakash/vim-zen): Barebones Vim plugin manager
- [vim-githubinator](https://github.com/danishprakash/vim-githubinator): Quickly show selected text on Github
- [vimport](https://github.com/danishprakash/vimport): Vim plugin to quickly import and drop modules

- [goodreadsh](https://github.com/danishprakash/goodreadsh): Command line interface for goodreads.com
- [pip-name](): Check whether a package name is available on PyPi
- [amizone-cli](https://github.com/danishprakash/amizone-cli): Command line interface for amizone.net
- [chromatic](https://github.com/danishprakash/chromatic): Create monochromatic backgrounds on the terminal

- [py-splice](https://github.com/danishprakash/py-splice): A Python interface to splice(2) syscall
- [dash](https://github.com/danishprakash/dash): Unix shell written with piping & history recollection
- [githubfs](https://github.com/danishprakash/githubfs): Read-only virtual file-system for Github using FUSE
