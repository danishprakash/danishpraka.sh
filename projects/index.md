# Dotfiles
I'm "passionate" about my setup, It has equal amounts of aesthetics and efficiency. I'd love to talk more about it but this is not the right place, maybe a post of it's own someday. Until then, here's the [repo](https://github.com/danishprakash/dotfiles).

```text
editor      : nvim
colorscheme : vim-yami
terminal    : iTerm2
font        : Fira Mono
mux         : tmux
shell       : zsh
os          : macOS
```
