title: The Psychology of Money
---

Was highly recommended to me by 2 of my good friends. This was a completely finance book Iâ€™ve read. It stitches together various facets of life and then infers the sometimes not-so-direct financial POV that makes so much more sense afterwards. There were quite a few learnings from this book and for me personally, has changed how I used to do certain things earlier.
