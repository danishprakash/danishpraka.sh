title: When A Tree Shook Delhi - The 1984 Carnage And Its Aftermath
---

A well-researched, intriguing and at times, frustrating account of the 1984 massacre from the very individuals who were at the helm of the movement aimed at ensuring the victims/affected the justice that they deserved. Itâ€™s safe to say that this book reveals shocking truth of the complicity of those in power. How the media was barred from reporting on the commission that was setup and how politics played out surrounding this whole unfortunate event that took place on that fateful night in Delhi. A must read.
