title: Underground - The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche
---

A reminder to what happens when religious fanaticism surfaces. This is an account of the survivors of the Tokyo Gas attack. As much as this book is gloomy, you get a view into the minds of the Japanese people. It struck me as to how many of the affected individuals were of the opinion that the perpetrators were not really at fault for what they did. A good read.
