title: I Will Teach You to Be Rich
---

Apart from the trite title, the book has a lot of good information on handling your personal finances, especially for someone who doesn’t know anything about the topic. The book expects you to follow through with 6 actionable items. The author can be very casual at times but in general, ends up giving you a sensible piece of information on which you can act upon. There are also anecdotal evidences of the mentioned plan along with the required facts and figures. A good read.
