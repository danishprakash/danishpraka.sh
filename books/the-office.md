title: The Office - The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s - An Oral History
---

It's a collection of excerpts from conversations/interviews with people behind The Office. It lets you in on the level of detail, the creativity and the amount of hardwork that goes into producing something of the level that you finally get to watch and enjoy. There's also a rundown on some famous milestones/events that took place during the show's lifetime for e.g. Steve Carrel leaving(not really) the show, the writers getting cast on the show. It's a good read if you're into The Office.
