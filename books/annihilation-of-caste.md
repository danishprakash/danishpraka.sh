title: Annihilation of Caste
---

It's just difficult to wrap your head around the fact that this was written back in 1936. A man way ahead of his time, a fervent supporter and leader of the anti-caste movement, Dr. B R Ambedkar, puts forth the case for the Untouchables. A lot of what he preaches, rather unfortunately, holds true even to this day. The annotations by S. Anand added more meaning to the content, setting the background and sharing some unbiased opinions extensively throughout the text. Now that I think about it, Ambedkar wouldn't have been able to publish such a text at all in this day and age and what does that tell us about our evolution/progression as a society? Read this book and you shall find out.
