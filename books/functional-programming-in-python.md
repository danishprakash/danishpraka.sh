title: Functional Programming in Python
---

I'm curious about functional programming. It's helps to look at things from a different perspective. Although, this is not a conventional book on functional programming as it talks about writing functional code in Python, which in itself, is a multi-paradigm language, but it does forces you to think functionally while writing Python code. It also goes on to talk about 3rd party libraries which allow you to write functional Python code.
