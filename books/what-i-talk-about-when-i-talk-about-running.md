title: What I Talk About When I Talk About Running
---

Quite a good read on running as a passion. Haruki Murakami takes this opportunity to talk about running as one of his hobbies and also reflects back about his life choices and how he ended up where he is right now. Some really interesting parts are where he talks about why running is perfect for someone(introvert) like him and the importance of failure and preparation. There's a lot to be learnt from this, worth a read.
