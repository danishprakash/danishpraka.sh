title: Never Split the Difference - Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It
---

The fact that the author himself was an FBI negotiator who talks about his anecdotes on crime negotiation makes this book worth listening to. But this book just isn't that, it'll help you negotiate better in life, whether that's a new job, a car, or the rent on a place. All that sounds good on paper of course and examples from the author's students further valorize the points made in the book but I haven't yet had the chance to consciously use any of the mentioned tricks yet, I'll make an effort to do so though. There's a lot of behavioral wisdom in this book even if you pull negotiating out of the context e.g. the importance of listening. A good read.
