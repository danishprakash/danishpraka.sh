title: In Other Words

Picked this up for two reasons, 1) It talks about the author's journey towards trying to master a new language which she fell in love with, and 2) She moves to Italy to delve into a new/foreign culture to be more close to it's language. It was a relatively short read but yet very insightful. The author shows both the good and the bad side of being a foreigner in a foreign land. She recounts her encounters, her struggle while settling in Italy. This books is originally written in Italian and the translator, Ann Goldstein, did a great job translating the subtle emotions and feelings the author tries to convey in her somewhat 'childlike' hold of the Italian language.
