title: The Ramayana
---

I'm not religious but I've been meaning to read this for a while. Since childhood, I've heard the Ramayana in one form or another, in parts and slots. I never had a chance to read it or watch the whole thing. R.K. Narayan does a really good job putting Kamban's poetic version into a prose. There's a lot to learn from this epic, such as the importance of being true to your own self, being disciplined and having principles.
