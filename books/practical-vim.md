title: Practical Vim - Edit Text at the Speed of Thought
---

I had read this book in bits and pieces a few years back on my phone and as much as I liked it, I wasn’t able to retain much of the information. This time however, I got a hard-copy issued from work and was able to take appropriate notes and it turned out to be pretty dense with information. I’ve been using (n)vim for the past 4 years or so and I ended up learning quite a lot of information from this book. A must read if you’re into vim.
