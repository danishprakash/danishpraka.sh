title: Nepal - Culture Smart! - The Essential Guide to Customs  Culture
---

I picked up this book before setting off for Nepal for a week. This book is a short read and walks you through Nepal's history, people, and culture both in-depth and on a surface level as and when necessary. Gave me a good understanding of how and why some things are the way they are in Nepal. All in all, a good read but only if you're planning to visit Nepal, otherwise it's essentially an abridged version of a Lonely Planet.
