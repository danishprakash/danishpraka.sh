Was half expecting his escapades with his famous life but no, this ended up being such a great memoir. It’s inspiring, encouraging and introspective at so different levels. I was particularly impressed by the fact that he happened to quit Law school and then later on picked up his bags and fly over to Australia for a year as an exchange student. I like the notion of that freedom wherein if you’re not happy with your current state and you need things to change, you pick your stuff up and move. This book has many instances of that and much more. Also, it was hilarious as fuck.
