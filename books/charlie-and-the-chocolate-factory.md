title: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Charlie Bucket, #1)
---

The very first book I read front to back. Finished this in 3 days because I had to return it to the school library and I was afraid to leave it unfinished. It was so fascinating to read this. Apart from the part which deals with the visit to the chocolate factory, the one thing I still remember about this book is the value of family, this was so subtly put into this book it's hard to miss. Must read.
