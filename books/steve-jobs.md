title: Steve Jobs
---

A bit late to this one but I’m glad I was. I’m sure I would’ve missed the parts about behavior and spirituality had I read this back in my first year of college. An account of the kind of person that Steve Jobs was, the great visionary and a terrible people’s man. There were a lot of things that went well for Jobs and I couldn’t help and think back the idea of Outliers but this is not to undermine the great late visionary. Walter Isaacson did a great job in keeping this biography neutral. It was very inspiring especially at the end where Jobs just refused to part ways from Apple and his love for creating great products. Good read.
