This is sort of a virtual bookshelf where I keep a record of books I've read with a small review. I don't talk about what the book is about in-depth here, I have linked them to Goodreads for that, but rather what I think of it. This was inspired by [rakhim's](https://rakhim.org/bookshelf/) much cooler bookshelf with all the book covers and authors. Anyway, here goes:

# 2018

- __[ The Ramayana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129876.The_Ramayana)__
<br>
I'm not religious but I've been meaning to read this for a while. Since childhood, I've heard the Ramayana in one form or another, in parts and slots. I never had a chance to read it or watch the whole thing. R.K. Narayan writes does a really good job putting Kamban's poetic version into a prose. There's a lot to learn from this epic, such as the importance of being true to your own self, being disciplined and having principles.

- __[Functional Programming in Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25977827-functional-programming-in-python)__
<br>
I'm curious about functional programming. It's helps to look at things from a different perspective. Although, this is not a conventional book on functional programming as it talks about writing functional code in Python, which in itself, is a multi-paradigm language, but it does forces you to think functionally while writing Python code. It also goes on to talk about 3rd party libraries which allow you to write functional Python code.

- __[Free as in Freedom 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11343000-free-as-in-freedom-2-0)__
<br>
Being a GNU/Linux enthusiast, I was always curious about the GNU project and this lead me to read this book. It is evident that the work done by the FSF has been greatly undermined and probably the only reason why many of us don't realize the contributions of the GNU project and the FSF community. Also, think twice before you refer to that distro on your system as "Linux".

- __[Milk and Honey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23513349-milk-and-honey)__
<br>
Very different from the stuff that I've been reading lately. The author gives a very crude account of her childhood with some disturbing yet not so uncommon details. Also, lots of vexed issues are discussed throughout the book and it's pretty evident why this book is all the talk amongst people lately.

- __[Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi \*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/290376.Indira)__
<br>
One of the best book I've read on modern Indian history. Talks about one of the greatest leaders of our country, with some flaws. There are certain bits that you'll read twice before you even begin to understand what had happened. Must read.

- __[The Linux Command Line](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11724436-the-linux-command-line)__
<br>
Can't say much about this one, it's a great book about the linux command line. Covers a bunch of commands and gives you a subtle intro to shell scripting. Loved reading this. It's divided into three logical units, so you can pick any one of them and start right off. It's a long read but very informative nonetheless.

- __[The Little Book of Hygge: The Danish Way to Live Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30045683-the-little-book-of-hygge)__
<br>
Not because it had my name on it, I read it because I'm interested in European culture and how they do things. It talks about Hygge, which is an important part of the Danish culture, there may not be a concrete definition of it but it refers to the feeling of being happy, cosy and comfortable with a close circle of friends with coffee in one hand while the thunder rumbles outside. Read it if you are interested in such things.

- __[When Breath Becomes Air \*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air)__
<br>
Amazing, thrilling yet saddening in so many ways. You can tell when the author picks up the pace because he knows if he doesn't then there might not be enough time to finish the book. Touches upon so many elements of the human life in such a way, it carries you through the whole journey. Must read.

- __[Norwegian Wood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood)__
<br>
Easy and relaxing, it gives you an insight about the japanese culture. All those talks about evening strolls and the japanese coffee places feels like an experience itself. It also talks about death, life and relationships. Overall, a good book and a fun read.

- __[1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984)__
<br>
How fortunate we are to live in a society like this, this makes you think not once or twice, but thrice about the society and how it functions. Although, it's a dystopian vision, there are instance where you can't help but relate it to your current situation.

- __[5/3/1: The Simplest and Most Effective Training System for Raw Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6381430-5-3-1)__
<br>
A great routine. But it was better off as a blog post, although I can understand the benefits of having a book. Anyway, read it if lifting is your thing, I learnt a fair bit about lifting from this book.

- __[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck)__
<br>
This book is basically the title being paraphrased repeatedly in different ways. Could have been a blogpost and done much better. I don't get the hype around this, it was average.

- __[Hit Refresh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30835567-hit-refresh)__
<br>
Some very important life lessons coupled with the transition of Microsoft from the old evil corp to the new community friendly organization, this was a delight to read. The part about Satya Nadella's childhood and his growth was particularly interesting. 

- __[The Story of My Experiments With Truth \*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112803.The_Story_of_My_Experiments_With_Truth)__
<br>
Apart from the usual stuff about Gandhiji that we find almost everywhere, this book talks about Gandhiji as a person, a student, a family man and later a father figure of our nation. There are accounts of his peculiar diet, his preferred method of medication and therapy and his immense love for reading. Must read.

# 2017

- __[Animal Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7613.Animal_Farm)__
<br>
This is a masterpiece, so elegantly written, it makes you stop and think about the uncanny resemblance the characters in the book share with some people we meet in real life, every few pages. A small but an interesting and humorous read.

- __[And Then There Were None](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16299.And_Then_There_Were_None)__
<br>
Overhyped. Some parts were good and some felt overly dramatic. This might be due to my high expectations from this book after reading about this almost everywhere. Just didn't felt exhilerating enough.

- __[The Girl on the Train](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272-the-girl-on-the-train)__
<br>
This was good, pretty gripping in fact. Unlike other crime novels, it was relatively slow paced and only picked up pace at the near end. The style of writing was good and very different. 

- __[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22514127-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python)__
<br>
I wanted to get into Python and this book was suggested by a lot of people on a lot of places where I asked for suggestions. Very easy going and the best thing about this is the projects that you do while going along. These projects are unlike other textbook projects, you use them in your daily routine and learn a lot from them.

- __[The Google Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164323.The_Google_Story)__
<br>
How it all began, from a typo to a verb, this is the story of how Google came up to be what it is today and how it has changed over the years. An inspiring account of an amazing product and an amazing team. Also, this book made me win two prizes in a GDG event, so there's that.

- __[Ghost in the Wires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires)__
<br>
Kevin Mitnick talks about his escapades with the FBI and how he tricked, or rather, fooled  a bunch of people while he was on the run using social engineering alone. There are bits about how all of this affected his personal life and relations with his own family. He then proceeds to talk about how eventually he became famous and went from being chased by the FBI for a good portion of his life to hosting a popular TV show.

- __[The Girl Who Played with Fire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5060378-the-girl-who-played-with-fire)__
<br>
A thrilling sequel to the original. Although not as gripping in the first half, it picks up a sudden pace immediately after the second half at which point it's hard to put it down. Again, read anything by Stieg Larrsson if you're even remotely interested in the crime genre.

- __[The Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865.The_Alchemist)__
<br>
Was okay, felt overly-stretched and still comes out as such a small read. Nonetheless, it has some great advice if you're seeking any. I picked it only because of all the praise around it but was left underwhelmed.

- __[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo)__
<br>
Probably the best book I've ever read. What a flow it carries. The characters are off-beat and the plot kept it all tightly together up until the very end. Stieg Larrsson is an exceptional storyteller. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up. It's pretty much evident why this book tops the crime/thriller categories so often.

- __[The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari \*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43877.The_Monk_Who_Sold_His_Ferrari)__
<br>
I made drastic changes in my lifestyle after reading this book and it was all for the better. There is some great advice in this book such as how to be a better vesion of your own self, how to pick up new and good habits and more importantly, how to make them stick with you. Must read.

- __[A Thousand Splendid Suns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns)__
<br>
A very different kind of story-telling. You are taken introduced to the plight of this young woman and the struggle she has to face during her marriage. Makes you sad, and in a weird way makes you cheer up at little wins of the characters in the story. Khaled Hosseini picks out the smallest of details of human nature and lays them out for the readers.

- __[iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/798635.iWoz)__
<br>
This was an amazing read. Steve Wozniak is such a genius, if it weren't for him, there'd be nothing for Steve Jobs to sell. That's what I understand from the book. Classic hacking anecdotes, university pranks and the rise of the personal computer, it has it all. 

# 2009

- __[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6310.Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory)__
<br>
The very first book I read front to back. Finished this in 3 days because I had to return it to the school library and I was afraid to leave it unfinished. It was so fascinating to read this. Apart from the part which deals with the visit to the chocolate factory, the one thing I still remember about this book is the value of family, this was so subtly put into this book it's hard to miss. Must read.
