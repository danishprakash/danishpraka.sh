title: Indra Nooyi - A Biography
---

This book was lying around on my Kindle and I just happened to open it one weekend. This book talks about Indra Nooyi’s extraordinary journey. Two things that I didn’t particularly supported were the portrayal of the entrenched patriarchy in Indian culture and how Indra Nooyi would justify drinking Pepsi is totally safe because she and her family does it daily, please no. Other than that, great book. Makes you realize there’s a lot of potential up ahead.
