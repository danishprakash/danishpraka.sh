This book is about the Japanese concept known as Ikigai which roughly translates to 'the happiness of always being busy'. It follows with a visit by the authors to the island of Okinawa which has the highest life expectancy in the world and discovering the secrets of the people living there, It talks about how the Japanese people don't stop working and moving regardless of their age. The authors visit various people in the town of Ogimi, Okinawa who are above 1years of age to talk about some of their habits. These include examples such as eating until you are 8full, practicing mindfullness, the Okinawan diet, doing yoga, taichi and drinking green tea. A good read but overhyped.
