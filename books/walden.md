People have preached (even criticized) Walden for generations. I'm not going to add anything new to the way this was written but since it's a review I'm going to share my opinion. First off, this book is not an easy read, there's a lot of ancient vocabulary, sentence structure and general personification, etc involved which makes it an intense read. Thoreau slowly builds up his case of moving to the woods and then pens down, in vivid detail, his experience there for a whole year. Even though it was published in 1854, you can relate to each and every bit. That's because he writes about Nature and Nature doesn't change, but I guess people do. For e.g. He writes in profound detail an ant fight over the course of a few pages, have you ever stopped to look at ants post-childhood? I know I haven't. We're so preoccupied with things, we don't stop and observe the life that's slipping past us. I have so much more to say and I'm sure I have enough to write a blog post for this book and I might as well do. Till then, read this book if you can. It'll change the way you look at life and perhaps even the way you live it. Must read.
