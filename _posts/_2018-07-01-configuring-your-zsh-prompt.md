title: Git branch in vanilla zsh
---

When I say vanilla zsh, i meant to say we are not going to use any of the fancy frameworks available for zsh, `oh-my-zsh` or `prezto`.
If you've been reading my posts, you'd know I avoid using such frameworks that add unnecessary overhead to your tool wherein the functionality you're looking for can easily be added via simple configurations.

Recently the thought of having the current branch indicated on my zsh prompt hit me, when I looked up for solutions, I was greeted with the idea of installing one of the frameworks for zsh which obviously was not my cup of tea. I then looked up for other solutions which sort of worked but sometimes broke unexpectedly. I came up with a simple solution that has been working great for me for the past month or so.
