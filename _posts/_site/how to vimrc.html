<p>There are probably more than a dozen such articles on this but you get to learn one or two tidbits from every such article you come across. My .vimrc or I’d rather say init.vim is pretty short and simple, it does what it is supposed to do and nothing more.</p>

<h1 id="vim-or-nvim">vim or nvim?</h1>
<p>I started off with vim back in my first year of college, realizing the grave mistake I’ve done by doing so, I quickly returned back to the good old Sublime Text. But after a couple of months, I came across this post on hacker news which talked about how vim can be interpreted as a language and also learnt like one. With that, I decided to give it one last try before I leave it for good. Obviously, that didn’t happen and I’ve been using it ever since. Not really though, I, fairly recently switched over to Neovim, mainly due to the availability of a number of good plugins, a builtin terminal and also because of it’s wonderful community.</p>

<p>But that shouldn’t matter much, since nvim is just an improved version of vim, there isn’t much difference between configuring the two.</p>
