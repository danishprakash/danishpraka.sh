<p>I was confronted with a decision when I writing up the documentation of a command-line application I recently wrote, <a href="https://github.com/prakashdanish/goodreadsh"><code class="highlighter-rouge">goodreadsh</code></a>. The problem was how to allow users to install my application, should I ask them to <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> the script and add it to their <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> and finally give it executable permissions? Because that is precisely how I’ve done it with a couple of applications I’ve built in the past. Then it hit me, I could atleast do mac users a favor and have my application available via homebrew.</p>

<p>I started looking up a bit on how you actually go about distributing your application on homebrew and I came across a couple of articles. The way homebrew works is quite simple, you make your application available as a tar archive and then write a homebrew formula and finally add it to the homebrew-core repo.</p>

<p>But boy I was wrong, there’s a lot that goes into getting all of that to work, if you happen to visit the homebrew repository on github, you’ll get the idea of how vast this project has grown.</p>

<h1 id="write-your-formula">Write your formula</h1>
<p>Homebrew formulae are essentially ruby scripts which stores information about your application. This is what a simple formula for an application written in bash would look like.</p>

<p>Now, almost all of the fields here are pretty much self-explanatory but we’ll go through them quickly.</p>

<p><strong>desc</strong>: small description of your application</p>

<p><strong>homepage</strong>: a webpage for your project, if you don’t have one, the project’s github repo will do.</p>

<p><strong>url</strong>: this is the url of your application’s tar archive.</p>

<p><strong>sha256</strong>: this is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sha</code> value of your application’s tar for authentication.</p>

<p><strong>head</strong>: link to your github repo.</p>
