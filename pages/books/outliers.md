title: Outliers - The Story of Success
---

Big fan of Malcolm Gladwell’s writing style and lately, his narration. This is a book that has a lot of those aha moments. It explains that it’s not just hard work that goes behind one of the most successful people of all times, there’s a lot more to it. Your upbringing, parents, opportunities that you got very early in your life, all of these compound to help you to get where you are today. Must read.
