title: Perfect Health Diet - Regain Health and Lose Weight by Eating the Way You Were Meant to Eat
---

I picked this book partly due to the foreword being written by Mark Sisson and partly because I wanted to try out a new diet this year. Apart from the cringey title, this books is really well-researched and makes a sound argument. Some of the suggestions still do seem a little controversial and open to interpretation but in general this book is a good read if you want to take stock of your diet and want to learn more about nutrition. I especially loved the section on supplementation although some of it is questionable based on further research that I did before opting into some of the suggestions in the book. All in all, a very good book if youâ€™re interested in the subject.
