Not an in-depth read on the topic. Scratches the surface for the most part on all-things-Linux focusing primarily on the container ecosystem. I picked this up because it was referenced in [Liz Rice's Container Security](/books/container-security) and when I checked the contents before buying, it looked decent. But I wasn't able to enjoy this book for the very reason that it was covering too much surface with little depth. But at the same time, if you're looking for just a passing introduction to Linux, this might be a good entry-level book. Anything more and you're better off skipping this one imho.
