Heard a lot about this book before finally deciding to read it. It makes you stop and think about things that you can relate to directly. The pleasures in life, how we succumb to them and finally there's the realization, but it's too late by then, which is one of the underlying lessons of this book, i.e the importance of time. A good book.
