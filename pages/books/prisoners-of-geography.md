title: Prisoners of Geography
---

Geopolitics is interesting and this book does an excellent job of satiating a surface-level interest for those interested. Understanding the working of a nation is not trivial, there are numerous factors at play, the history, the geography, the people, etc and by extension, explaining it in mere words is more difficult. The book still manages to talk about almost every country in the world and how they have been blessed or condemned by their geography. The author poignantly concludes by saying that a majority of the issues in our world are because those at the helm of nations are "skeptic" about what the other might do and this is where it leads us, to wars and loss of life. And as long as that sentiment is what drives us, things are not going to be different even if we move to space in the future. A good read if you're into the topic.
