title: Food Rules - An Eater's Manual
---

A very short read. This book puts forth the fact that nutritional science is very young compared to other sciences and that we still don't have answers to questions arising from the effects a particular nutrient on our body. With that aside, there are a total of 64 simple and easy to remember rules that one should follow while eating. Some of these rules are based on science and some are based on what has been proven to be useful to us humans hitherto (नुस्खे). All in all a quick and goodread.
