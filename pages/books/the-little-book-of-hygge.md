title: The Little Book of Hygge - The Danish Way to Live Well
---

Not because it had my name on it, I read it because I'm interested in European culture and how they do things. It talks about Hygge, which is an important part of the Danish culture, there may not be a concrete definition of it but it refers to the feeling of being happy, cosy and comfortable with a close circle of friends with coffee in one hand while the thunder rumbles outside. Read it if you are interested in such things.
