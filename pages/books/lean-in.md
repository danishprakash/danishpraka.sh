title: Lean In - Women, Work, and the Will to Lead
---

This is the kind of book I think everyone who's part of the modern corporate culture should definitely read once. As a male, I'd have never expected how difficult it is for women to pursue a career let alone strive in one, and how the most menial of things are challenging if you look at it from their perspective. In order to be mindful of these issues, I think awareness needs to come first which is where this book comes in. On the flip side, the argument is how men can't do housework even if they choose to because of the stigma attached to it. I for one, seriously hope we overcome this barrier and this book has helped me rethink and approach things very differently than how I used to going forward. Must read.
