title: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

Probably the best book I've ever read. What a flow it carries. The characters are off-beat and the plot kept it all tightly together up until the very end. Stieg Larrsson is an exceptional storyteller. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up. It's pretty much evident why this book tops the crime/thriller categories so often.
