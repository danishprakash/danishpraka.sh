title: Confessions of a Yakuza
---

Went into this expecting some heinous crimes that are usually reported as part of a Yakuza story these days but was surprised to find out that being a Yakuza back in the day really meant taking care of your people and your customers (gamblers), albeit in ways that were not considered legal (e.g. gambling). It deals with tricky familial relations, coming-of-age in the pre-war Japan and the (in?)famous Japanese psyche. A good read if you're interested in Japanese culture.
