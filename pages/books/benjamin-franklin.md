title: Benjamin Franklin - An American Life
---

This was a very long read. Walter Isaacson provides insights and corrections at times in the book. It is a somewhat neutral view of one of the founding fathers of America. It talks about how America was built, the importance of industriousness, frugality and civic sense in a society and nation in general. There's also the quintessential underlying story of rags to riches but in a more serious context. I especially liked Franklin's habit of writing things down, having a schedule and a process for even the most mundane of things. If you don't intend to read the whole thing, I suggest you read up on Franklin's 12 virtues which he talks about in great detail in his autobiography.
