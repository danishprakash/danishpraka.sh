Although marked as fiction, it gave strong hints of a memoir. It read like an extremely powerful novel. The novel is a letter to his mother who can't read, he opens up about everything. Their provenance in war-torn [Vietnam](/posts/vietnam) and then their lives in the US as immigrants who try very hard to blend in. It gets quite emotional and dark at times and the style of writing just complements the overall theme of the novel. I did find the fragmented timeline a bit difficult to keep up with and the lack of an overall arch made it difficult for me to link back to some events. It was a good read.
