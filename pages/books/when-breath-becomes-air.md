title: When Breath Becomes Air
---

Amazing, thrilling yet saddening in so many ways. You can tell when the author picks up the pace because he knows if he doesn't then there might not be enough time to finish the book. Touches upon so many elements of the human life in such a way, it carries you through the whole journey. Must read.
