A wild journey through the ugly realities of the food production industry. I had known some of these haunting details before going into the book given my brother is in the field. It's far from the [plushy jobs](/posts/be-humble) folks have in the IT industry as a whole, especially in terms of the physical demands of the job. One quote from the book succinctly describes what I'm trying to say -- "You should be mentally and physically prepared to be treated like cattle for the first few years in the industry, cattle are slightly more useful though". The writing was engrossing and the off-handed anecdotes were super interesting. His droll accounts of his fellow sous-chefs, runners, and waiters all made for an interesting read. Really good read.
