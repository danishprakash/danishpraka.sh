Fun, interesting read on all-things container security. Starts off easy with an introduction to what a container really is, touching upon different virtualization techniques and then coming back to talking about the nuances concerning packaging and running applications within containers. It's a relatively new release and hence also mentions hot-topics such as rootless containers and container profiling via eBPF. I did wish for it to go a little deeper technically on some of the topics but still enjoyed it thoroughly.
