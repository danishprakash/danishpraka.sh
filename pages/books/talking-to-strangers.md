title: Talking to Strangers
---

The author talks about how we, humans, are incapable of dealing with a stranger and uses some important events from the past to help corroborate his arguments. If you're interested in human psychology, this would be a good read, recommended. On a side note, the narration of this book along with the music and the score enhanced the whole experience.
