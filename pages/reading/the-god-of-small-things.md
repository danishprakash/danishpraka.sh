I picked this book up out of respect for Arundhati Roy, she was one of the few celebrities who actively participated in the protests that took place in Delhi. About the book, a very vivid and enthralling is how I'd describe this book If I had to in one sentence. I understand why people adore Arundhati Roy and her writing style so much. She paints pictures with words and you are forced to take a moment and imagine the very scene in your minds. I don't usually read fiction but this was welcoming, I feel I can now read more of fiction of a similar style. Recommended.
