title: Why I Am An Atheist
---

This book's mere existence was surprising to me. I had always attributed the greatest of our revolutionaries to be devouts but not Bhagat Singh. Here was a young soul with an intellect rare to find with his age, a mature mindset and an unparalleled love for his nation. Among other things in this book, he talks about why he turned an atheist. He puts forward logical arguments and asks relevant questions to fellow theists as to why God, if there's one, created this world of miseries and sorrows. This books throws light into the kind of stoic thinking he developed at the very end eventually asking the Government to have him shot instead of hanged.
