I had the pleasure of visiting Kazakhstan to attend a wedding.  Normally when I read a book in the [culture](/reading/bhutan-culture-smart) [smart](/reading/indonesia-culture-smart) [series](/reading/malaysia-culture-smart), I'm left to my imagination when it comes to topics such as local interaction, marriages, etc. But this time it was different, I experienced most of it firsthand and it was nothing short of amazing. It was quite surreal to be reading about a ritual and then recalling that that's what we did last night.

Kazakhstan—in the tourist circles—is known for its massive and breathtaking landscapes, and all the accounts were true. I personally enjoyed the cities more, [Almaty](/photos/almaty-kazakhstan-2025) and [Astana](/photos/astana-kazakhstan-2025), are amazing places, to live and to roam around. The weather was favorable, and the fusion of modern Kazakh and old Soviet culture was seamless. There's a focus on economic growth, and it can be seen in the rampant private construction in Almaty and mostly government, in Astana. The people are particularly delightful, so hospitable and helpful. There were so many locals that were genuinely interested in talking to us which made the whole trip slightly more enjoyable and memorable.

The book is well organized, it covers the history of Kazakhstan, the pre-Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet eras, and how it affected the public's psyche, both positively and negatively. Slightly outdated, as with all other culture smart books, with some sections that feel irrelevant, it does a decent job giving you a cultural and geographical outline of the country, which is what I generally look for in these books. Another solid addition to the culture smart series, a good read!
