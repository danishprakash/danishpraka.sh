Aptly titled, it talks about literally everything. I listened to this on Audible and it was surprisingly smooth sailing, I did find taking notes while listening a bit difficult but It was well worth it. The author tries to clear up questions that you always had in your mind for e.g. “What really is the big bang all about?”, “How did life came to be?”, “What’s the deal with dinosaurs going extinct?”. There were certain parts in the book where you felt like slogging but overall, the author and the narrator rightly so, made this book a pleasant listen.
