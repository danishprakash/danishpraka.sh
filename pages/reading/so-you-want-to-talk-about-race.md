Before I read this book, I thought of myself as one who is very careful about the cultural, racial, and sexual identity of an individual. But as it turns out, it's not so simple, I realized that I had been racist in the past and maybe even today, and as much as that has to do with my moral values and beliefs, our society and the system play a much bigger part in all of this. It's not only when -- although it's the worst kind -- you verbally or physically berate an individual that constitutes racism, concepts such as cultural appropriation, privilege, etc are some of the ways in which you can inflict or suppress those in the minority. Throughout this book, there were lots of learnings, unlearnings, and revelations. Do give this a read.
