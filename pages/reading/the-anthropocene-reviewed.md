Went into this immediately after reading [Sapiens](/reading/sapiens) just because it was categorized into the same bucket of evolution and anthropocene, but I was initially a bit disappointed with the kinds of topics being discussed or the kind of scientific backing I was yearning from the previous title. I've never read John Green's previous works before but eventually and thankfully the format and the witty reviews of the anthropocene grew on me. The book talks about the most mundane of items and then goes on to explain its provenance and the its significance in the author's life, whenever necessary, it's a review after all. Covering a wide variety of things such as the qwerty keyboard, the yips or the call of the kauaʻi ʻōʻō bird, this book makes for a really interesting, yet casual read. Also, I wasn't aware that this book was written during the onset of the pandemic and reading/listening about those days felt a bit weird after a few years now. All in all, a good read.
