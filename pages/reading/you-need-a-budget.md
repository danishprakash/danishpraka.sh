This is a “budgeting” book from the founder of YNAB, a budgeting software with a very different philosophy than your usual track-what-you-spend. Even if you don’t use YNAB, this is a quick weekend read which will force you to think about spending and managing your money in a way that would probably make you scoff for the first few times you try it but it’s worth a shot.
