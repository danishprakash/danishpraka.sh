A very different kind of story-telling. You are taken introduced to the plight of this young woman and the struggle she has to face during her marriage. Makes you sad, and in a weird way makes you cheer up at little wins of the characters in the story. Khaled Hosseini picks out the smallest of details of human nature and lays them out for the readers.
