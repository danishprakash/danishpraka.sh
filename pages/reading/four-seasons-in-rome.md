This book is about the author moving to Rome with his wife and two newly born twins for a year, much like Thoreau moving to Concorde, Walden except Rome has a beaming civilization. He talks about his life in Rome and extensively talks about parenting which was really hard-hitting and amusing at the same time. The difficulties one experiences when moving to a new country with a different language and where people do things differently than your native country have been explained in such vivid detail, it's hard not to imagine yourselves on the streets of Rome, walking towards the Fontanone while the city is engulfed in bright sunlight. The observations are just too keen at times and I often found myself thinking about how authors have a way of looking at even the most ordinary things which we oversee as being normal e.g. I remember Ruskin Bond and Henry Thoreau having explained ordinary daily life experiences as some larger than life-like events. Lastly, the author has passingly explained so much of the rich Roman history while visiting and explaining the museums, palaces, churches, and sculptures in Italy that it becomes difficult to resist the urge to visit Italy once in your lifetime. A very good read.
