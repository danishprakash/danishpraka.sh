I was a little apprehensive before listening to this because the reviews I've read all say that the floral writing style of F. Scott Fitzgerald is second to none, and I wondered if it'd be comprehensible and convenient enough as an audiobook.

But I listened to it for a bit and found it approachable. It's funny how extremely descriptive and polished the writing is. To be able to paint a picture, that too so vivid, by words is pure genius. Even the minutest of details found themselves carefully explained and described. The story itself is a slow reveal; we're introduced to characters one after the other, and the buildup around Gatsby was fantastic. I didn't quite like the (anti)climax; it all felt a little too rushed and abrupt. A slight touch of blandness and dreariness in the overall tone of the book, but a decent listen nonetheless.
