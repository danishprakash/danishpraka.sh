Being a confused atheist from the age of ~16, I naturally had a lot of questions I wanted to clear up when it came to anything that concerned religion, be it the fanaticism, the rituals, or the teachings. This book clears up a lot of those questions and quenches the thirst that is very typical of an amateur atheist. I think this book fills a lot of gaps, taking this term directly from the book, in your understanding of what religion is really is. I no longer vacillate between being an agnostic or an outright atheist, it's the latter. A very good read.
