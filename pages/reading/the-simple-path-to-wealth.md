I'm firmly in the passive index investing school of thought that was pioneered by John C. Bogle and although much has been said about index investing by the man himself, in [The Little Book on Common Sense Investing](/reading/the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing/), It helps to read about people's experiences with this investment philosophy.

The author talks about his personal journey with ups and downs in the market and how he settled with index investing for good. He encourages the same for a majority of investors looking to get into the market. There's some good information and general food for thought about saving as much as you can and spending less than you earn and the usual nuggets you'd find on any other sane personal finance blog.

If you've read John C. Bogle's book, I don't think you need to read this one, the philosophy is quite simple and you don't need a ton of books to read to absorb it. This book was also heavily focused on the US so bear that in mind if you do decide to read it.
