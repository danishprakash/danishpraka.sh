This was an exploratory read, I wanted to understand religion and why people go above and beyond for the same often times leading to ethically and morally wrong actions. But as it turns out, the Bhagavad Gita is a purely self-help guide narrated to Prince Arjuna by Lord Krishna. It was surprisingly good, would recommend.
