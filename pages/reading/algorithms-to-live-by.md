Not quite the practical hands-on book I was expecting when I read the title and the synopsis. In turn, it tries to connect a lot of commonly used computer science concepts to real life. For instance, optimal stopping, searching, sorting, randomization, etc. The second half of the book was more interesting with discussions on topics such as Interrupt Coalescing, Overfitting, Relaxation, and Game Theory. A decent read.
