I'm interested in reading about different cultures and I picked this up for the same reason. The author has a very witty way of writing, very humorous. In terms of the content, the author talks about her life in Denmark for a year studying the traits of the Danish people trying to figure out why Danes are the happiest people on the planet. Early on in the book, it was conveyed that while people in the US fight for more money, the Scandinavians fight for more time, for themselves and for their families, which I think is the perfect analogy.
