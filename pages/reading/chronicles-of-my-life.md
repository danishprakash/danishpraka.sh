Another book on foreign culture, Japanese this time. The author by accident gets interested in Asian culture, first Chinese and then Japanese. He tries very hard to go to Japan and when he eventually does, he's struck by the sheer simplicity of the Japanese people. He talks worryingly about the westernization of Japan, how the native Japanese art, music and literature is getting lost among the youngsters. He's visibly worried about too much cars on the streets, too much fashion in the Japanese societies, the diminishing interest of people/tourists in Japanese temples. A good read.
