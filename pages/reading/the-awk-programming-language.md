I like command line tools for their brevity, for their declarativeness and efficiency. Awk is one of those tools that you end up using every now and then but for printing out just that $n column. Awk is capable of doing much more than that. This is one of the best technical books Iâ€™ve read despite it being dated. The authors give a comprehensive overview of the practical capabilities of the language and to the extent it can be used in software engineering not just devops. A very good read.
