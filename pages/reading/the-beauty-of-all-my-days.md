A short read, I was able to able to read most of it on a flight. Ruskin Bond writes in a casual and humorous manner which makes it a very light read. There's no chronology in the chapters and you can essentially pick up anyone at random. They cover a broad range of topics from his childhood days in India, his struggling writer days in London, and then finally his current life in Dehradun, India. In between, he mentions how a lot of things have changed in life over the course of the past few decades. A good way to get into Ruskin Bond. A good read.
