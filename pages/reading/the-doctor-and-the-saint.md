A damning account of the quest for equality for the Untouchables. Even more concerning is the revelation of how Gandhi(ji) was a casteist and how he dealt with the issues surrounding Untouchability in India. Most of the information in this book was new to me and it left me incredulous at times. This book essentially talks about how Dr. Ambedkar fought diligently for the rights of the Untouchables and how he was caught off-guard from the "caste Hindus" of which Gandhi(ji) was probably the most well-known and respected at the time. I read this book as the introduction to Annihilation of Caste but it's a self-contained read on its own. Arundhati Roy does a great job reiterating history with some of her own interpretations, some of which felt a little extreme at times but either way, it's a must-read.
