Great book on (almost)all things Kubernetes. I’ve been working on Kubernetes for over an year now and it always helps if you understand the systems you’re working on. For instance, knowing how an Ingress controller refers to the Service’s Endpoints resource to forward connections to pods, would, apart from scratching that proverbial itch, will also help you debug and build better systems on Kubernetes.
