Taking a closer look at the ones who survived this terrible act by humanity, the author tries to put to words that fateful day and the ones after that. A whole town uprooted in a literal flash, people burned to shadows and other atrocities that arose out of the bombing. Immediate aftermath of the bombing lead to whirlwinds and fires and even flooding which added more misery to the ones who were already badly injured and suffering from an utter lack of resources. It was a tragedy in the truest sense of the word. Do read this.
