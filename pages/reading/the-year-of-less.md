Went into this thinking I could perhaps try something similar for the upcoming year's goals but this book is actually a memoir. The author shares her tumultuous yet reckless teenage years and how she turned the whole thing on its head for the better. She shares the teachings she had out of these experiences in the past few years of her life. It's not a bad book, a decent memoir but recalibrate your expectations before picking it up.
