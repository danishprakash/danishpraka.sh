title: How Google Works
---

Recommended by my previous manager. This book has a lot of insights into how Google operates differently from other companies. It talks about how to manage and work with smart individuals in an organization. Anecdotes from Google's old days are equally interesting giving backstories on how certain Google products came to fruition. It's not too technical but rather takes a managerial viewpoint. I was hoping to get more technical insights but the contents of this book are are spun more around people management.
