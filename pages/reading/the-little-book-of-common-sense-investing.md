title: The Little Book of Common Sense Investing
---

A classic on investing with a focus on Index funds. John C. Bogle is the creator of the world's first Index fund. He swears by the returns of investing in an Index fund over managed mutual funds or even ETFs. There is historical data to prove and he also very loosely predicts the upcoming trend, which is not so lucrative but still favors the returns offered by low cost Index funds, all this with a disclaimer of course. His arguments make sense and if you're interested in finance or investing, this is a good read.
