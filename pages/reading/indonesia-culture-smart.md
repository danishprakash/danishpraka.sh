These titles, as I'm sure I've mentioned previously, gives the reader a quick overview of the landscape of the country, the people, and its history. This was no different, Indonesia is a land of drastically different cultures and landscapes. For instance, it tells you why there's a sizeable Chinese population in the country or how the Japanese occupation of Indonesia was slightly different than others. You also find trivia such as how the founder of Singapore, Thomas Raffles, was once a Governor of a province in Indonesia. It was a decent read but only if you plan to visit or you're interested in the country for some reason.
