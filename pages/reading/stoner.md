I listened to this one. It’s a ride through the life of Mr. Stoner, an academic professor dealing with various issues he encounters as he discovers himself. It’s really grim at times and you’ll find yourselves rooting for the protagonist. It talks about family, relationships, friendship and life in general. Might as well start looking into fiction a bit more, much recommended.
