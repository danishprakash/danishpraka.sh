We've all read how Sugar, processed in particular, is bad for health. I was in the same boat for quite a while but I didn't know why this was the case. This books goes back, way back into the advent of sugar in our diets. It then traces it's path while comparing the glaring increase in chronic diseases. It's quite frightening what all Sugar is capable of doing to us and at the same time, and it's quite surprising, the reason why it's one of the most widely used substance in almost all the processed foods, is how corporations work and lobby for their interests.
