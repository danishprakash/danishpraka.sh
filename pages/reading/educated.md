A very inspiring memoir of a girl from an extraordinarily weird family in which her parents didn't believe the government, they avoided going to the doctors at all costs, they didn't allow their children to go to school, the list goes on. In the midst of this chaos, Tara Westover carves her own way out to earn a degree from Cambridge and then Harvard. Must read.
