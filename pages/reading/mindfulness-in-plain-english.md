I've tried meditation on and off in the past 2 years but never got around to fully understanding what the fuss is all about and in order to get a more clear understanding, I picked this book up on recommendation from a friend. This books is a thorough practical guide to mindfulness, it talks about it's origins and specifically discusses 'Vipassana' meditation. It also helps as a how-to guide if you're just starting with meditation. The author has a pretty good writing style. Recommended.
