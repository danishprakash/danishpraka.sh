Quite similar to the [Singapore edition](/reading/singapore-culture-smart) and understandably so, it used to be a single land mass before the eviction but the people and the culture remain more or less the same.

Enjoyed the first half, as usual, with all the history and the "ethnography" of the people. One thing quite struck me was how dated this edition was. There was talk of reading a map or going blindly into a place. I couldn't really understand some of it until it really struck me. The second half, again, was a little boring but it still had good reading material on the nitty-gritty details of doing communication and business with the Malaysian people. It's a fascinating multi-ethnic country and I was talking to my manager just the other day about how the Malaysian people were able to overcome their ethnic differences, to whatever extent, and cultivate a civilized society. I was really ignorant about developed, in general, South East Asian countries are. I'm enlightened now.
