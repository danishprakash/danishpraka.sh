title: Man's Search for Meaning
---

This book is divided into two parts. In the first part, the author talks about his time as a prisoner in the concentration camp(s) and it's just gut-wrenching to go through it. Some of the examples are too much to take in. The second part of the book is more analytical and consists of a brief overview of Logotherapy. Overall, the book drills down hard on the fact that there is indeed meaning in suffering. That (wo)man is ultimately self-determining and that they have the final decision on what they'll become in the next moment irrespective of their condition, suffering and/or surroundings. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who's reading this.
