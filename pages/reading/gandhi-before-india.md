title: Gandhi Before India
---

I've read Gandhiji's autobiography but Ramachandra Guha does an extraordinary job at putting forth the upbringing of the Mahatma. Our current political as well as social situation when juxtaposed with that of Gandhi's time, will force you to think how back in time we've come. The burning of his effigies, the comparison and often times, the blatant defamation of him just goes on to tell how well aware people are when it comes to our own history.
