I started this book in the same shoes as the author, barely used social media but still wanted to understand why there's an ever-expanding problem of digital media overconsumption plaguing our modern societies. The author presents a rather well-researched "theory" of why it is so. Taking examples from Thoreau and Roosevelt to Tristan Harris and the likes, the book presents a plausible explanation of why it's so difficult for people to go cold turkey on their social media addiction and how big tech corps are changing the way we used to live our lives, how a conversation is being replaced with a like or a text message. The second part of the book presents the reader with a list of action items that would help them cure the problem which I found were quite useful. It's a must read if you think you're dealing with social media overdose.
