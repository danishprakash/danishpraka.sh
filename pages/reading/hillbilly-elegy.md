Quite similar to [Educated](#tara-westover) in terms of the overall theme, this is the story of a boy from Kentucky, the countless number of struggles he and her sister faced and despite all this, how he and her sister beat all odds to have a 'normal' life after all. There's also the underlying notion of the importance of education.
