Another book on Japanese culture, this talks much more about the Japanese life and it's people than the one by [Donald Keene](#donald-keene). There was an equal divide in this book wherein one part talks about what's so good about Japan that so many people admire it. And the second part talks about the lesser known darker secrets of the Japanese society which is at times, tough to read but nevertheless, insightful. A very good book and a very laid back style of writing. A good read.
