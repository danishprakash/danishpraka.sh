Fascism is more apparent than we think it is. It's difficult to wrap around the fact that people are more concerned with blatant lies laid down by the demagogues and not with the real issues that would directly affect their lives. This book talks about how Fascism works, what are the ways in which a Fascist tries to appeal to his/her target audience and how Fascism has, in a wrong manner, shaped the world that we live in right now. It becomes increasingly worrying how eerily similar are the things the author talks about in our current society.
