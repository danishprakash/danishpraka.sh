This was a recommendation from a friend. I had never heard of Alfred Adler before this, but like others, have heard of other prominent psychiatrists such as Freud, Jung, etc. This book is written in a very easy-to-digest manner, a discourse between a young man(you) and a philosopher, taking direct inspiration from the Dialogues of Plato. There were times in the book when it felt like the authors are aggressively undermining Freudian psychology rather than _just_focusing on Adler's, which could be a little off-putting given what they are preaching. But that being said, I learned a ton of new actionable items from this book. It revolves around the concept of "Individual Psychology" or how only you can change yourself in the here and now. Adler also emphasizes community contribution and a feeling of belongingness which eventually helps a person make the change. Additionally, the examples put forward are the ones you can relate to i.e. they are set in the modern world, they talk about job struggles, etc. A very good read.
