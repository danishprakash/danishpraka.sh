title: Wise and Otherwise
---

Not sure how I picked this book up but I'm glad I did. Sudha Murty has been doing philanthropy for quite some time now and naturally, she has had the opportunity to visit places we might not be able to point on a map. She shares stories involving deceit, love, charity, societal prejudices, issues pertaining to women and family etc. Often times an emotional roller coaster, this book can teach you a lot about human tendencies.
