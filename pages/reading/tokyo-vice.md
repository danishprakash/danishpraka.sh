A rather refreshing read. Author talks about how the organized crime in Japan works. He shares stories from his time as a reporter for the police beat in Tokyo, his encounters with the Yakuza. Along the way, it touches upon the problems deeply rooted in Japanese culture concerning drugs, alcohol, and the booming sex industry. On the flipside, there's subtle mentions to how the Japanese value friendship, kinship and loyalty. Recommended.
