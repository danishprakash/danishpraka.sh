Quite interesting but slow paced at times. This book talks about the authorâ€™s time when she taught students at Stanford about things such as coming up with a solution to a problem which is not possible to solve in the first place. The book has countless examples which shows how, when people think differently, they are able to achieve so much more than they bargained for.
