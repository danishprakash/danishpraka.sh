This is a unique book, the author sits down with people or descendents of those who had to migrate to the other side of the border during one of the most unfortunate instances in Indian history, 'The Partition' and discuss their journey circulating around a material object which they carried with them. The result is an amalgamation of history, memories, materials and sorrow. In almost every chapter, you've to stop and think about the lives of those who had to leave everything behind in moment's time and move to a place not known to start life afresh, it's haunting.
