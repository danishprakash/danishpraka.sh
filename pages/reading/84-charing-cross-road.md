A collection of letters between a struggling writer in the US and a book dealer in London. The correspondence starts off very formal but soon after, it evolves into a friendship that is cherished by parties on either sides. It also gives the reader an account of life in London in the post-war era and also the immense love for reading in some people. A delightful short read.
