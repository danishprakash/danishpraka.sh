Another memoir from someone who gets to spend their informative years in Japan. This memoir from Victoria hits a niche, specifically Kaiseki, a special traditional meal that surrounds a traditional tea ceremony. The memoir is set in Kyoto and the author recounts her days with a Japanese family which was ready to accept a gaijin as part of their family. Thereâ€™s lots of culture strewn around in the book with visits to markets and onsens. Good read.
