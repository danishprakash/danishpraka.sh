A great book that outlines the misogyny in the modern world. Although a work of fiction, you’d be hard pressed not to think otherwise. Some of the instances are something I’ve heard about in India and it’s safe to say this is not just a South Korean thing but rather something that stems from the patriarchal history of a majority of Asian cultures. Good read.
