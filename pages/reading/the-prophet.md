Before picking this up, I read somewhere about how this was a product of its time and I think I agree now. It just sounded like drivel for the most part, at least 80% of it. Honestly, it felt like the kind of stuff promulgated to keep the masses in line. Things like, keep working hard, finding joy in pain, etc. It just doesn't feel right to be preaching stuff like this to someone anymore, for some reason.

It was not all dull though, I liked some bits, particularly the part about giving and the purpose of friendship. I was reading another review and someone said they are not just mature enough to understand Gibran yet, well I at least hope that that's not the case with me.
