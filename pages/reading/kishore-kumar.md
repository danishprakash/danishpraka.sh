Ever since [this](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/spotify-saregama-india/) happened, I've been listening to [classic bollywood songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4podnuUgMNTjpJYLMYJYmg) especially those by Kishore Kumar, part of the credit goes to my dad for those passive listening sessions. This book is a short read but it gives you some idea of the tumultuous life of this person, his creative ways of doing things and his eccentricity.
