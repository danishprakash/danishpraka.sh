Repetitive, as is expected from a self-help book. I agreed with a lot of things in the book, most of which is common knowledge. At the same time, I disagreed or was not fully satisfied with what was presented to the reader. If you were to be joining Bridgewater, this might come off as a decent read. But if not, you're better off skimming it or going through a summary somewhere.
