A very inspiring personal account of an individual with a harsh childhood resulting in little to no self-confidence in himself which eventually led him to a life many despise yet live today, a life with no virtue and no goals. David Goggins turned his whole life around with sheer determination. He mentions a goal in every chapter which will help the reader to pursue his/her goal in life. But apart from these goals what really stood out were the incidents of his struggle, failures and eventual success.
