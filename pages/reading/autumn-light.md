My first exposure to Pico Iyer's frantic yet engaging writing style. He has lived a very fascinating life and this book talks about one aspect of his life which is set in Japan, especially Nara and Kyoto. The underlying theme of the book is 'death' and how people deal with it. If you're into reading about Japanese culture, at one point you'll come across stagnation once you've read all the popular works which are present in almost all foreigner-in-japan reading lists. It's difficult to find books which offer something beyond the usual to readers but this book does just that. I'm certainly going to read more from Pico Iyer and if you're into Japanese culture and have reached stagnation, you should definitely give this a shot.
