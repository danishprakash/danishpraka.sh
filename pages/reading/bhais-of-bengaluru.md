A short yet gripping book about the Bengaluru Underworld. The organization of the book is a bit fragmented because I think the timeline itself is such a complex maze. Apart from that, every chapter is more or less self-contained with lots of nostalgic nuggets in the form of familiar street names, old restaurants, glimpses of how nightlife used to be in Bengaluru back in the 60-80s, etc. The most interesting aspect of this piece of work is the character portrayal, their backstory, their rise to (in)fame, and their eventual demise. There's also one small detail I came across in the book--the provenance of Kannada(language) activism and how it arose, it put things into perspective a little. A good read if you're into crime.
