Quite an interesting and thorough read on nutrition. The author describes how the diet of our ancestors helped them and how our current diet has become nothing short of a man-made disaster in itself. Over the course of this book, she describes how certain physiological functions work in our body in terms you and I can understand. She puts forward a strong argument for a meat-based diet, a recommended read if you're interested in nutrition.
