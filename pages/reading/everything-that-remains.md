Picked it up as an aside light read. The author talks about his successful corporate journey till his mother's demise which forced him to take another look at his life. He realized that he wasn't really happy despite having achieved everything that society has chalked up as a requirement for being successful. He comes across a video by Colin Wright and learns about minimalism and then embarks on a journey with his colleague/friend Ryan to tell the world more about this relatively unheard-of (back then)concept. That being said, this book is average. I'll not really recommend this book to someone and so If you're looking for a structured, actionable, and yet a gentle introduction to Minimalist, I'd suggest Fumio Sasaki's Goodbye Things.
