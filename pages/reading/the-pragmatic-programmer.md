Having read a few books around the topic best practices, this book essentially felt like re-reading a collection of programming dos and don'ts articles. If you've been in the industry for a while, you might not find something really valuable out of this book. In fact, there are references to old frameworks, programming languages and formal processes which might not be relevant to you at all from a technical point of view. 

On the other hand though, if you're just starting out in CS, this should provide you with some basic tenets to follow to ensure a relatively smooth ride ahead in your programming career. I specifically liked the chapters on testing and documentation the most.
