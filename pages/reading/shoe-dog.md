title: Shoe Dog - A Memoir by the Creator of Nike
---

This book was honestly a surprise. I opened to skim it and ended up reading a couple of chapters. It is very well written. Phil Knight takes you along on his journey around the world to find “self” and also to bring to fruition his crazy idea. How Nike came to be, the people behind it, the problems they faced. I also loved this book thanks to the Japanese influence on Phil Knight after his first visit to Japan. A very good read.
