I don't usually have trouble creating habits but this book explains the 'how' of my habits working and I'm guessing, it'll be really good for folks who are starting out on being more productive, for lack of a better word. I do feel that there's a certain trite(ness) associated with resources that focus around productivity but this book focuses just on Habits and how they can lead you to attain some really great goals. Also interesting were the real life anecdotes strewn around in the book.
