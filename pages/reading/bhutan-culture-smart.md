The Land of the Thunder Dragon and "The Last Shangri-La" are some of the titles bestowed upon this small country nestled up in the eastern Himalayan foothills.

I picked this book up a week before I was supposed to go on a 5-day ad-hoc trip to Bhutan. It does a good job of painting a picture of this exotic and unique nation. Its rich history is entangled between Tibet, India, and Nepal, with many of its founding figures migrating from the neighbouring region. They have—predominantly Buddhist—deities looking after various aspects of one's life, similar to Hinduism, and I'm sure many other religions. It's said that Buddhism was brought to Bhutan by an Indian Tantric who helped the then king to subdue a demon, who, in return for this favor, converted to Buddhism, leading to its widespread adoption amongst the people.

It's a constitutional monarchy, and honestly, quite lucky for Bhutan, the king is as humble and devoted to the populace as the populace is to him. So much so that a vast majority of people have the king's photo up in their homes or on themselves in the form of badges. I also found the concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH) extremely well targeted; the locals talk fondly about it, they live it, and the administration drafts their policies while keeping the GNH principles in mind. A nation geared towards happiness, it's got a nice ring to it. It was also surprising how the government has regulated the tourism industry, prioritizing the welfare of the locals, the habitat, and the tourists.

The people are sweet, approachable, and very humble. The king preaches humility, and so it's no wonder that when everyone talks to you in a submissive, borderline servile manner, it's part of their culture, and very much apparent. They talk highly of Bhutan, don't shy away from talking about its problems, but at the same time, don't spare a moment appreciating the paradise they call home. No traffic lights, no honking, barely any litter, and pleasant weather, Bhutan might just be the last Shangri-La.
