title: Leaving Microsoft to Change the World - An Entrepreneur's Odyssey to Educate the World's Children
---

This is a great book about what really goes into behind the scenes if you’re working non-profit for the betterment of society. It’s not smooth-sailing at all and it requires sheer grit and determination to pursue it to the very end. The book starts off with the author’s well-settled albeit hectic lifestyle and then quitting all of it to help children read books, literally. It’s emotional and encouraging. Good read.
