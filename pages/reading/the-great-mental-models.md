Quite an interesting collection of mental models with practical uses and examples in real-life. I didn't know how useful mental models or what they were for that matter before this, It's a way of looking at a problem and thus crafting new and novel ways to solve them. I was particularly impressed by the Inversion mental model of thinking, it's such a simple exercise but has dramatically useful outcomes. The author does a great job at supplementing real-world examples with every model he explains which makes it all the more easier to try incorporating it into your life. I'm currently figuring out how to actually recall and retain these models to apply while problem-solving. It's a good short read.
