I haven't read a lot of classics, but since this is my season of audiobooks, and because I saw this title being included in my audible subscription, I started listening to it on a whim. I wanted something that didn't require intense focus or having me do lots of thinking after every other sentence.

This is a story, primarily about an English family. Elizabeth Bennet is the narrator and the protagonist who finds herself at odds with a Mr Darcy. The plot thereafter was quite predictable, given I'm listening to it after more than 200 years, but it still holds up as an intriguing tale of English manners, riches, courtship, and drama. Surprisingly, I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, in fact so much so that I had to [watch](https://letterboxd.com/danishprakash/film/pride-prejudice/) the 2005 movie adaptation shortly afterwards. A thoroughly enjoyable listening experience.

Final word on the audiobook production; it was nothing short of phenomenal, replete with an original score, sound effects, and an actual cast. I'm glad such extravagant audiobook productions are now a thing.
