Kevin Mitnick talks about his escapades with the FBI and how he tricked, or rather, fooled  a bunch of people while he was on the run using social engineering alone. There are bits about how all of this affected his personal life and relations with his own family. He then proceeds to talk about how eventually he became famous and went from being chased by the FBI for a good portion of his life to hosting a popular TV show.
