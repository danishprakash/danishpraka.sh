_People in their right minds never take pride in their talents._

I used to be dismissive of fiction, as was fashion back when I got into reading. If you're even remotely serious about reading, you'd find yourself deep into non-fiction bestsellers or if you're really serious, philosophy. And if you skim through my [reading](/reading) list, you'll know how much I believed in that notion.

I can now say that wasn't true, not for me at the slightest. Over time, fiction has taught me a lot of things. And if I had to recommend a work of fiction to someone asking, it'd be this one. For this is such a deep and complex story that is full of meaning. At its very core, this is a story about racism. But the genius is in having the story narrated from the POV of a little girl who happens to be the daughter of a wise and righteous lawyer. She clearly doesn't understand the implications or consequences of what's happening around her and it's left entirely up to the reader to grasp the gravity of what's going on. Even though this is fiction, having a moral compass even remotely close to that of Atticus Finch's is a lofty goal worth pursuing.

I wouldn't really have picked this book if it weren't for Audible including it in my membership, and how glad I am for that. Genuinely good read.
