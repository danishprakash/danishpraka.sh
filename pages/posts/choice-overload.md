title: Choice Overload
---

We live in an age where we have a lot more choices for virtually ever single thing. Think of mobile phones, to-do apps, cutlery, pens, movies, etc. We're living in truly enlightenened times, or are we? On more than one occasion, I've found myself struggling to choose from an endless options of things to choose from. I feel we used to live in simpler times with lesser options to choose from but at the same time with lesser cognitive overload, Choice Overload is a cognitive impairment after all.

This is not to say that having options is a bad thing, far from it. It enables people from different backgrounds or cultures to live a comfortable life. For instance, if we only had high-end SUVs for people to travel in, the world would be a very different and inconvenient place for a lot of us. But at the same time, I _feel_ there's a loss of personal connection when it comes to having too many options.

### Movies
Quite difficult these days to settle in on something and to find time. (causal or anecdotal) but I remember back when I was in 4th, we'd somehow catch hold of a DVD and then it was family time. On many occasions, cousins and neighbours would join in on a Sunday afternoon for a movie and everybody would get together and enjoy. People have varying choices and very rarely they'd want to sit together and watch something unless it's extremely popular and good.

### Music
FM and MTV and VH1. The source was common and you'd wait for the song to come up and it was fun. The choices were extremely limited (in that you had little control on what would come up and there were very limited sources) so you'd enjoy almost anything that played. Contrast that with Spotify and Apple Music.

### Books
Anomaly, you've better choices now and more accessibility. It has been a solo activity so not much to lose anyway. But then again, we hardly take into account recommendations from someone, at not as frequently as we talk about other sources of information/media.
I will usually prop open reddit to get some recommendations from random strangers on the internet and further research about the titles to see if that's what I really want to read next.
When I read memoirs or accounts set before the advent of internet, people used to read based on personal recommendations all the time because that was perhaps the only way to get reccomendations back then.

### Restaurants
So freaking hard to decide on what you want to eat and once you decide that, you're caught up in a never ending mire of where to eat. This is more pronounced when you're ordering in because there the options open up more.
When choosing for a place to eat out, there are usually tangible restrictions abound such as the distance or whether the place has availability, do you have to take reservations. Then you need to think about the weather, the transportation and after clearing all these hurdles, you reach your destination to enjoy your meal.
Whereas while ordering in, all you need to do is to _choose_. You have a a myriad of options and there are no physical restrictions attached to them, you can order anything you want as long as it's there on the screen. This makes it all the more difficult.

### Gifts
This is a fun one. It was so much easier to gift someone something. Limited choices made it easier to choose quickly and the likelihood of the person enjoying it was also greater. Nowadays, it's just impossible to gift someone something they'd like unless or until they had given you a list beforehand.
I thought one day about how I would like to receive a gift while I was wondering what to gift someone. I realized how with all the shopping options available online these days, I'd much rather prefer a gift card so that I can buy something I'll use (I like to consider myself a utilitarian) rather than receiving a perfume for the umpteenth time.
But..I still have to ask someone which gift card they'd like to have which is still one hop more than I'd have preferred. But usually they are receptive to the idea of a gift card and sooner or later they share what they'd like to have.
