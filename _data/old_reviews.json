An account of the kind of person that Steve Jobs was, the great visionary and a terrible people's man. There were a lot of things that went well for Jobs and I couldn't help and think back the idea of Outliers but this is not to undermine the great late visionary. Walter Isaacson did a great job in keeping this biography neutral. It was very inspiring especially at the end where Jobs just refused to part ways from Apple and his love for creating great products. Good read.",

It's difficult to wrap around the fact that people are more concerned with blatant lies laid down by the demagogues and not with the real issues that would directly affect their lives. This book talks about how Fascism works, what are the ways in which a Fascist tries to appeal to his/her target audience and how Fascism has, in a wrong manner, shaped the world that we live in right now. It becomes increasingly worrying how eerily similar are the things the author talks about in our current society.",

In terms of the content, the author talks about her life in Denmark for a year studying the traits of the Danish people trying to figure out why Danes are the happiest people on the planet. Early on in the book, it was conveyed that while people in the US fight for more money, the Scandinavians fight for more time, for themselves and for their families, which I think is the perfect analogy.",

It was a relatively short read but yet very insightful. The author shows both the good and the bad side of being a foreigner in a foreign land. She recounts her encounters, her struggle while settling in Italy. This books is originally written in Italian and the translator, Ann Goldstein, did a great job translating the subtle emotions and feelings the author tries to convey in her somewhat 'childlike' hold of the Italian language.",

For instance, he learnt Portugese, he learned how to play drums and played at shows, learnt drawing and had his own art show and even played in a samba band and a bunch of other things. At the end, the author also talks about how science is being affected by the mindset of people who think less about the essence of it and rather the fame they hope to get out of it. One thing that I took away from this book was to put in efforts learning about things that truly interest you.",

There's also the quintessential underlying story of rags to riches but in a more serious context.
